## 介绍
Think of RxJS as Lodash for events.

ReactiveX combines the Observer pattern with the Iterator pattern and functional programming with collections to fill the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.

在 RxJS 中用来解决异步事件管理的的基本概念是：
- Observable
- Operators 
- Subscription
- Subjects
- Scheduler

## Observable
Observables are lazy Push collections of multiple values. 
Observables 是多个值的惰性推送集合。
